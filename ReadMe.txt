** Introduction **

F*CSS is a custom CSS parser for Flash. The main class called FStyleSheet (found 
inside of the com.flashartofwar.fcss.stylesheets package), goes well beyond the 
native StyleSheet class by supporting style inheritance, pseudo selectors, and 
merging styles on the fly. The goal of F*CSS is to make styles something you can 
apply to any of your classes instead of just TextFields. CSS is a great way to 
define your classâ€™s properties in an external file and F*CSS helps convert these 
css styles into property/value pairs you can apply to any Object.

** Examples **

You can download the FCSSExamples project from GitHub here:

http://github.com/theflashbum/fcss-examples

If you don't have time to get those, here are a few simple examples to get up
and running quickly.

** CSS Sample **
// Get some css. Normally you would load CSS from an external file but
// for this example we are going to put some CSS in a XML variable.
 
var css:XML = <css><![CDATA[
 
demoStyle
{
	autoSize: left;
	border: true;
	border-color: red;
	color: red;
	size: 30px;
	selectable: false;
	x: 50px;
	y: 50px;
}
]]>
</css>;

** Style A TextField **

// Create a new StyleSheet
var styleSheet:IStyleSheet = new FStyleSheet( );
styleSheet.parseCSS(css.toString());

// Get a style (Returns an object with properties as strings)

var style:IStyle = styleSheet.getSelector("demoStyle");

// Create a TextField
var tf:TextField = new TextField();

// Use TextFieldUtility to apply the style to the TextField
TextFieldUtil.applyStyle(tf, style);

// Use TextField like you would normally
tf.htmlText = "F*CSS - Hello World";
addChild(tf);

** Global StyleSheetManager **

// If you want to make the CSS available globally use the 
// StyleSheetManager/StyleSheetCollection
                        
// Get a reference of the StyleSheetCollection from the StyleSheetManager
var styleSheetCollection:IStyleSheetCollection = StyleSheetManager.collection;
                        
// Register style sheet with the Collection.
styleSheetCollection.addStyleSheet(styleSheet, "defaultSheet");
                        
trace(styleSheetCollection.getSelector("demoStyle"));

** TextFieldFactory **
// In order to have the TextFieldFactory work you must have at least 1 StyleSheet
in the StyleSheetManager.

// The first param is the id. It will add # to the string to provide like HTML/CSS
var textField:TextField = TextFieldFactory.createTextField("demoStyle", "TextField");

** Apply Style to any object **

// Get a Style
var demoStyle:IStyle = StyleSheetManager.collection.getStyle("demoStyle");

// This can be any class
StyleApplierUtil.applyProperties(*AnyClassInstanceGoesHere*,demoStyle);
